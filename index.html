            <p class="sectionSubTag">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. 
                Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. 
                Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves.
                <p class="sectionSubTag"> Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect
                     on the way one thinks, feels, 
                    or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and 
                then college, university, or apprenticeship.

            <p class="sectionSubTag">Educational technology (commonly abbreviated as EduTech, or EdTech) is the combined use of computer hardware, software, and educational theory and practice to facilitate learning.[1] When referred to with its abbreviation, EdTech, it is often referring to the industry of companies that create educational technology.[2][3]

                In addition to practical educational experience, educational technology is based on theoretical knowledge from various disciplines such as communication, education, psychology, sociology, artificial intelligence, and computer science.[4][full citation needed] It encompasses several domains including learning theory,
                 computer-based training, online learning, and m-learning, where mobile technologies are used.
